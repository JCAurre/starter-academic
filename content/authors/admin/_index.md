I use strong-field gravity to probe fundamental physics. My area of specialisation is numerical relativity, which is the use of high-performance computing methods to solve Einsteinâ€™s equations of general relativity to study cosmological and astrophysical phenomena in
the most extreme regimes of gravity. I am part of the GRChombo collaboration http://www.grchombo.org/.

<!-- I went to Saturnino de la Pena high school in Sestao (Bizkaia) and pursued the degree in Physics at the University of the Basque Country where I specialised in fundamental physics. I completed the MSc in Quantum Fields & Fundamental Forces at Imperial College London before moving to King's College London, where I am now a 4th year PhD student under the supervision of Eugene Lim. -->
