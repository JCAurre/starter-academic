I am a 4th year PhD student at King's College London under the supervision of Eugene Lim. My main research area is the strong field regime of gravity, in particular I am interested in gravitational waves and theoretical cosmology.

I attended the Saturnino de la Pena high school in Sestao (Bizkaia). I pursued the degree in Physics at the University of the Basque Country where I specialised in fundamental physics. I completed the MSc in Quantum Fields & Fundamental Forces at Imperial College London before moving to King's College London, where I am now a 4th year PhD student.
